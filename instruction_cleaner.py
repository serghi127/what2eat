Pour the broth and vinegar carefully into the pan, and return it to the oven a final time, to roast for yet another 15 minutes, or until the garlic cloves are tender and the liquids have been reduced to a thin (or nonexistent) puddle.

        "Confirming\nBasically 475Â° for 30 minutes?\nBefore the broth & vinegar?",
        "Yes. I know sometimes people skip the first flip at 15 minutes if you're looking to reduce steps.",
        "With convection, it might even out or close. Just keep an eye on it and use these photos (charred! almost dangerously so!) as guidance.",
        "This sounds so good! Do you think if I didn't want to use vegetable broth I should just use water?",
        "Did I just make half this recipe and eat it by myself? Yes, yes I did. ð¥¹",
        "I started with chunks but you could do wedges too. Honestly you could try this same ingredient approach (vinegar, etc.) but with the melting potatoes recipe.",
        "I had to fight off my 11, 10, and 5 year old daughters to eat the rest of this! I now have a house full of cabbage converts!",
        "Unrelated, but I love purple cabbage to make what I call \"secondary salad\" (because it's purple orange and green the secondary colors on the color wheel). I just mixed purple cabbage, shredded carrots, and something green (green onions and or herbs) and add dressing, usually some kind of garlic vinaigrette, and often cheese and nuts. It's delicious.",
        "I never expected to find te word 'worrisomely' in a recipe but it's definitely intriguing, adding a new dimension to my cooking.\nWonderful!\n;-)",
        "My next choice would be apple cider, then white wine. Rice is very mild, and red wine would stain to an ugly color",
        "It will be sweeter and less acidic but could still work!",
        "This recipe has been a staple in my house since Smitten Kitchen Keepers came out!",
        "Ours too.  I make it with half malt vinegar and half white vinegar, as a nod to my British husband.  And the crunch of Maldon salt is swoon-worthy in and of itself.",
        "I definitely need to make this! We made a corned beef dinner this spring and instead of boiling the veggies, found a recipe with veggies roasted in a horseradish butter.  And while the potatoes and carrots were delicious, the cabbage was a revelation!  Now I want to eat all the roasted cabbage :)",
        "I'm one of those just knowing it will be fantastic for me. Cabbage is worrisomely underrated. Just one question: what do you usually eat with it to make it a meal? Looking forward to making this :)",
        "I came here hoping for an answer to the same question! Anyone have any tips? Is it enough of a meal on its own or does it need something else? Looking forward to making it this week!",
        "This time I'm serving this with some leftover ham.  Will fry a slice to serve with this cabbage.",
        "i only own rimmed, too! learned a trick from America's Test Kitchen â for the delicate cookies that require a proper rimless cookie sheet, simply flip the rimmed sheet over and use the underside. i tried this with a delicate speculoos cookie recipe, and it worked beautifully.",
        "https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/11199-belgian-spice-cookies-speculoos (i believe the baking sheet tip is in the video)",

        "This is a favorite in our house and my 5 year old regularly requests it.",
        "Has anyone tried this with Napa?  (I assume less cooking time, as a start.)  I love basic green cabbage and this is on the list!, but I happen to have 1/2 a large Napa in the fridge, waiting to be cooked or tossedâ¦.",
        "Just wondering if you can adapt this to include BOTH THE POTATOES, and the cabbage as well to make a wonderful serving of veggies and carbs in a happy marriage.",
        "Yes, just swap out half the cabbage for wedges or thick slices of potato.",
        "Can confirm- even my kids love this. It's incredible.",
        "I had 1/2 head of cabbage languishing so obv had to make this. I chuckled when I checked my copy of Keepers and saw the post was lifted from the book!  So so good ð¤¤",

        "OMG I doooooooo have an old cabbage in my fridge! Making this tonightâ¦",

        "This has been a recipe that makes me so sad to hate vinegar since the moment I first saw it.  That cabbage looks incredible!  I once accidentally ate one of my partner's salt and vinegar chips (his ended up on my sando plate, so I expected it to be a regular chip) and cried.",
        "You could do the same roasting and skip the vinegar. Roasted cabbage, kale, etc., is so very delicious. (Go with a squeeze of lemon or orange or lime if you still want a tang, or skip it, or add herbs instead.)",
        "While this recipe is great in chunks, I've done it with leaves â shorter time, crispier bits and more like chips (same way I do kale/collard chips).",
        "Who knew that a cabbage serves 2?    Around here it does now!",
        "This is one of my favorite recipes from the cookbook! I've been raving about it to everyone and so glad I can just send them this link now.",
        "I'm not sure it's the right cooking method for it. Make this salad instead!",
        "I also didn't have vegetable stock and used water, and if you do this, I recommend generously salting to taste at the end. We liked it very salty.",
        "Also, we appreciated the advice to cook until \"worrisomely charred.\" It was just right.",
        "My family loved this! Like homemade sauerkrautâ¦yum! Can't wait to make it again!",
        "If you ever want to combine the cabbage and cauliflower on one sheet pan, don't miss this one: crispy cabbage and cauliflower salad",
        "Wow. Bless you for bringing this into my life! Who knew the sad cabbage (literally wasting away in the back of my fridge as foretold by you) would lead to the most unexpected, glorious, mid-week lunch party for one (me).",
        "Yes. And this way it doesn't taste burnt, either. It just appears very dark.",
        "It's great to eat right away. You can reheat it but it's not chips; there are crispy and soft parts.",
        "After making this twice in one week, I'm here to say: if you've ever thought \"hmmm, I wonder if I could eat a whole head of cabbage by myself\" then this is the recipe for you. Perfection.",
        "I tried this several times and the cooking time shud be 30 min",
        "Really yummy, easy, and adaptable to adding other things. I also threw in some apple, as others suggested, and some spicy chicken italian sausage. So good!",
        "We make this almost once a week. We often add Whitaker mushrooms to the sheet pan. They add a different texture and complementary flavor. We make two pans often because it tastes great cold as a slaw the next day with some grated carrots added for a touch of sweetness and for a little color.",
        "Enjoyed this. Then to reheat, I put it under the broiler so it was truly charred cabbageâ¦.then served it with an egg cooked in chile crisp.  YUM.  With some sliced farmer's mkt tomatoes on the side.  Really recommend",
        "Oooh reheat under the broiler. Great idea. I can eat an entire cabbage this way. So good. And the egg and chili crisp? A+"
